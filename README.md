# ML
Machine learning projects

1. Trained a machine learning model that can accurately predict health insurance prices for individuals based on attributes such as age, sex, region, etc.
2. developed an ML model for lung cancer prediction. Given information about the patient, such as their sex, age, allergies, etc.
3. Designed and trained two neural networks using PyTorch to tackle the regression and classification tasks in the two last projects.
4. Designed and implemented a CNN to be used in a task of Medical Image Classification. Given an image of an MRI/CT/X-ray scan, the model is to predict the body part being scanned.
