# Machine learning Projects

1. Trained a machine learning model that can accurately predict health insurance prices for individuals based on attributes such as age, sex, region, etc.
2. developed an ML model for lung cancer prediction. Given information about the patient, such as their sex, age, allergies, etc.
3. Designed and trained two neural networks using PyTorch to tackle the regression and classification tasks in the two last projects.
4. Designed and implemented a CNN to be used in a task of Medical Image Classification. Given an image of an MRI/CT/X-ray scan, the model is to predict the body part being scanned.
5. Trained a ResNet-18 model using the fine-tuning Transfer Learning method based on IMAGENET1K weights and from scratch using the Kaggle dataset for the classification task.
6. Built an LSTM-based model for time-series forecasting using PyTorch. Given a series of data points (the Amazon Stock dataset), the model should be able to predict the next data point.
7. implemented color clustering for an image using k-means from scikit-learn.
8. Trained a different model for the classification task to predict lung cancer using a dataset available on Kaggle by employing a range of algorithms such as KNN, SVM, GaussianNB, Decision Trees, and AdaBoost.
